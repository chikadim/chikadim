## Hi there 👋, my name is Chika

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm a strong believer in learning and upskilling! Presently i find so much fun doing full stack projects. When i am not building something or learning something new, then you can find me playing table tennis, listening to music, meeting with valuable people or spending time with my family ❤️.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a food delivery app in React Native with scalable database architecture.
- 🌱 I recently built some apps you can find pinned on my profile just below 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and real world projects!
  - Send me ideas to cckrist@outlook.com
